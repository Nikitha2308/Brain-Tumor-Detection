# Brain-Tumor-Detection
An efficient brain tumor detection method, which can detect tumor and locate it in the brain MRI images. The detection and classification of MRI brain tumors are implemented using different wavelet transforms SVM based interface using GUI in Matlab.  Accurate and automated classification of MRI brain images is extremely important for medical analysis and interpretation.
